# Getting Started with App

This project is a simple illustration of registering user, login user and perform user actions in user profile following a timed based session (implemented using jwt tokens).

## How to run the project locally

Since this is a locally hosted project you have to start a mysql instance in your local machine and add credentials in the code to run it successfully.

### `npm start`


Using the command you can start the backend and frontend into two different terminals and once both start spinning together you can make request using your browser.

**Note: do not forgot to change `port` of the backend server in the frontend file otherwise you will not be able to make request from frontend!**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
